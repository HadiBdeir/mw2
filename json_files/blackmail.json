    "description": "Cyber blackmail is a crime where hackers try to trick or pressure you into giving away private data, money, or doing something inappropriate. They may claim they have access to your private photos, videos, or browsing history — and threaten to leak them unless you obey. Victims often feel ashamed or too afraid to speak up or get help, but you're not alone — and support is always available to you.",
